# Problem

I have a set of Java or Scala source files. I want to train a language model to:

1. Read my source files.
2. Analyze my source files such that the annotated parts of the code, e.g. methods and functions, to be included as part of an API that the language model uses as its context
3. The language model receives user input as natural language
4. Based on the its understanding, the language model will map the user input to calls to "annotated" parts of the code
5. The language model returns events, e.g. GetAccountInfo(<account-id>)


# Solution

This is an excellent application of large language models (LLMs) for code interaction, often referred to as "Function Calling" or "Tool Use." Here's a breakdown of how you can approach training such a model, along with key considerations:

## Core Concepts & Strategy

The fundamental idea is to train an LLM to understand natural language queries and, instead of generating free-form text responses, to generate structured calls to functions (your "annotated parts of the code") with the correct arguments.

## Here's a strategic overview:

1. **Code Analysis & API Definition:** You need a systematic way to extract information about your Java/Scala methods and functions. This will form the "API" the LLM understands.
2. **Data Generation (Crucial!):** This is the most important and often most challenging step. You need a dataset of natural language queries paired with the corresponding "API calls" (function calls with arguments) that your LLM should generate.
3. **Model Selection & Fine-tuning:** Choose a base LLM and fine-tune it on your generated dataset.
4. **Inference & Execution:** When a user provides input, the fine-tuned LLM will generate the API call, which you then execute in your application.


### 1. Code Analysis & API Definition

- Automated Extraction: You'll need to parse your Java/Scala source files to extract method/function signatures, their parameters (with types), and their return types.
    - For Java: Use a Java parser library (e.g., ANTLR with a Java grammar, JavaParser). You'll traverse the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to identify methods.
    - For Scala: Use a Scala parser (e.g., Scala's built-in parser, or libraries like Scalameta). Again, you'll work with the AST.
- Annotation Processing (Optional but Recommended): If you use custom annotations (e.g., @ApiMethod, @ExposeAsApi) in your code, your parser can specifically look for these annotations to determine which methods/functions should be part of the LLM's API. This gives you fine-grained control.

- API Schema Generation: For each annotated method/function, generate a structured representation (e.g., JSON schema) that describes its:
    - name: The function/method name.
    - description: A natural language description of what the function does (crucial for the LLM's understanding). You might need to manually write these or try to generate them from Javadoc/Scaladoc.
    - parameters: A list of objects, each with:
        - name: Parameter name.
        - type: Parameter type (e.g., "String", "Int", "Account").
        - description: A natural language description of the parameter.
        - required: Boolean, whether the parameter is mandatory.
    - return_type: The type of the value returned.

## Example API Schema (JSON):

```
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "getAccountInfo",
      "description": "Retrieves detailed information for a specific user account.",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "accountId": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The unique identifier of the account."
          }
        },
        "required": ["accountId"]
      },
      "return_type": "AccountInfo"
    },
    {
      "name": "createOrder",
      "description": "Creates a new order with specified items and quantity.",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "productId": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The ID of the product to order."
          },
          "quantity": {
            "type": "integer",
            "description": "The number of units to order."
          }
        },
        "required": ["productId", "quantity"]
      },
      "return_type": "OrderConfirmation"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Data Generation for Fine-tuning

This is where the "training" comes in. You need a dataset of (natural language query, API call) pairs.

- Manual Creation: For a small, proof-of-concept project, you could manually create these pairs. This is time-consuming but offers high quality.

    - Example:
        - Natural Language: "Get me the details for account 123."
        - API Call: GetAccountInfo(accountId="123")

- Semi-Automated Generation:
    - Prompting an LLM (Self-Supervised): You can use a powerful pre-trained LLM (like Gemini, GPT-4) to help generate training data.
        - Provide the LLM with your API schema (the JSON you generated in step 1).
        - Prompt it to generate natural language queries that would correspond to calls to these functions, and then the exact JSON output representing that function call.
        - Careful: This approach requires validation to ensure the generated data is accurate and fits your desired output format.
- Variations: Generate multiple natural language queries for the same API call to improve robustness. Include variations in phrasing, synonyms, and even incomplete information (if your model should handle it).

### 3. Model Selection & Fine-tuning

- Choose a Base LLM:
    - Open-Source Models: Consider models from Hugging Face (e.g., various Transformer architectures like T5, BART, or even smaller LLMs fine-tuned for instruction following). These give you more control and can be run locally.
    - Cloud Provider LLMs (with Function Calling APIs): Many commercial LLMs (like Google's Gemini, OpenAI's GPT models) now offer native "function calling" capabilities. This simplifies the process significantly as the model is pre-trained to generate structured function calls. You provide the model with your API schema, and it attempts to map natural language to those functions. You still fine-tune, but the base model is already very capable.
- Fine-tuning Process:
    - Input to LLM: The natural language query.
    - Output from LLM: The structured representation of the API call (e.g., a JSON string, or a specific format the LLM is trained to emit for function calls).
    - Training Objective: Teach the model to predict the correct function call and its arguments given a natural language input. This is typically a sequence-to-sequence task.
    - Tools:
        - Hugging Face Transformers: If you're using open-source models, this library is essential for loading, fine-tuning, and evaluating.
        - TensorFlow/PyTorch: For more custom model architectures or training loops.
        - Cloud AI Platforms: If you're using a commercial LLM, their SDKs will have fine-tuning capabilities.

### 4. Inference & Execution

Once your model is fine-tuned:

- User Input: The user provides a natural language query.
- LLM Inference: Pass the user's query to your fine-tuned LLM.
- Parse LLM Output: The LLM will return a structured representation of the predicted API call (e.g., {"function_name": "getAccountInfo", "parameters": {"accountId": "123"}}).
- Dynamic Method Invocation (Reflection/Metaprogramming):
    - In Java, you can use Java Reflection to dynamically find and invoke the getAccountInfo method on your corresponding object, passing the accountId parameter.
    - In Scala, you can also use reflection, or leverage Scala's more powerful metaprogramming capabilities (e.g., using scala.reflect.runtime).
- Return Events: After the method is executed, capture its return value. You can then wrap this return value into an "event" object (e.g., GetAccountInfoResult(<account-info-object>) or OrderCreatedEvent(<order-confirmation>)) and return it.

## Key Considerations and Challenges

- Data Quality and Quantity: The performance of your LLM will heavily depend on the quality and diversity of your training data. For complex APIs, this can be a significant undertaking.
- Ambiguity and Error Handling:
    - What happens if the user's query is ambiguous or doesn't map cleanly to an API call? Your model should ideally handle this gracefully (e.g., by asking for clarification, or returning a "no relevant function found" event).
    - How will you handle errors during the actual API call execution? The LLM might generate a valid-looking call that fails at runtime due to incorrect data or external system issues.
- Context Window: LLMs have a limited "context window." For very large codebases with many functions, you might not be able to provide the full API schema as context for every query. Strategies include:
    - Selective API Provision: Only provide the most relevant API functions based on some initial keyword analysis of the user's query.
    - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Store your API schemas in a vector database. When a user queries, retrieve the most semantically similar API schemas and provide those to the LLM.
- Security: If your API calls modify data or have sensitive operations, ensure robust authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place when the LLM triggers these actions. The LLM itself should not have direct execution privileges.
- Maintenance: As your codebase evolves, your API schema and training data will need to be updated. Automate this as much as possible.
- Performance: The latency of LLM inference can be a factor. Choose a model that balances accuracy with inference speed for your use case.
- Scala vs. Java Specifics: While the general approach is the same, be mindful of language-specific nuances in reflection, type systems, and tooling. Scala's functional paradigms might lead to slightly different "function calling" patterns than Java's more object-oriented ones.

This is a powerful and increasingly common application of LLMs. By carefully planning your data generation and integrating with robust execution mechanisms, you can build a highly effective natural language interface to your Java/Scala codebase.
